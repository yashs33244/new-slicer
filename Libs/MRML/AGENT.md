# Agent Context — Libs/MRML/

MRML is the scene graph / data model. No Qt dependency in `Core/` or `Logic/`.

- New node types: implement all pure virtuals, register with scene, add XML read/write
- Node references preferred over raw pointers
- Displayable managers live in `DisplayableManager/`; Qt widgets in `Widgets/`
- Test with: `ctest -R MRML`
