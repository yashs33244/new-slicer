# Agent Context — 3D Slicer Root

You are working on the 3D Slicer medical imaging platform (C++/Python, Qt6, VTK, ITK, MRML).

## Primary Rules
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in each subdirectory before editing files there.
2. Never push to remote without explicit user approval.
3. Commit prefix: `ENH:` / `BUG:` / `STYLE:` / `DOC:` / `TEST:`
4. Never edit generated files (check for `# DO NOT EDIT` or `/* DO NOT EDIT */`).
5. Python 3 only; Qt6 APIs only.

## Before Any Change
- Confirm the target directory's CLAUDE.md for patterns/conventions.
- Run relevant ctest after changes: `ctest --test-dir ../Slicer-build -R <pattern> -V`

## Branch Policy
- All work on `develop` branch (or feature branches off it), never directly on `main`.
